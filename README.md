## Introduction
This project has been made for storing stock and customer records like booking number, customer number, name, phone number, charges for room etc. it contains addition,
modification, deletion and searching of bills, generating of bills as per requirement. Total amount is being calculated automatically.

The main aim of my project is to create bills as per entered booking number by the user. It helps to store the records of customers in particular tables (items) and
these records can be easily accessed by the person in a fast manner.

## Abstract
This tool requires a RDBMS, which is used to store the information and Mysql is the preferred software for maintaining the data. It maintains the information in the table form so that it can be accessed easily.

In this client side we will be using Java Net beans 8.2 providing the user interface. The requests of the client are made in the interface, which connect to the tables created in Mysql for getting the current  information.
